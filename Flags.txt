This game shows historical relevance in multiple ways:

-The Great Britain level represents the American Revolution which 
 lead to the spread of democracy and various revolutions elsewhere.

-The Middle East level represents American cultural imperialism and
 the spread of a western influenced global culture.

-The Panama level represents American imperialism and focuses
 specifically on America's involvement with the Panama canal.

-The Chinese level represents China's tendency to isolate itself and
 western efforts to break this in order to benefit by trade.

-The Soviet Union level represents the Cold War between the United
 States and the USSR and specifically the arms race.

-The Antarctica level can represents America's reputation as a 
 world power but is mainly there just because.

-The France level is a joke.
